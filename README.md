# AxisConsolidator

##Update
It seems I may have created this mod in response to some bug. After plugging in different controllers and resetting various settings to default the jetpack in the base game now matches the player look direction when this mod is turned off.  
I will leave this mod available because others have had issues with the stick inversion, and this also gives the option for players to have the jetpack inversion follow the ship instead of the player. Original text for this mod below. 

------------

Outer Wilds mod to align jetpack flight vertical look direction to either player or ship setting

This mod changes the behavior of the vertical (y-axis) look direction for the player when using the jetpack.

In the base game the vertical look direction while in zero-g with the jetpack is always opposite to the setting for the player while standing. This means that it is impossible to configure the y-axis to always be inverted in all situations, or to never be inverted in any situation.

-------------

This mod adds a setting for "Use Ship Look Direction."  
If the setting is disabled, the y-axis look direction while using the jetpack will match that of the player at all times.  
If the setting is enabled, the y-axis look direction while using the jetpack will match that of the ship.
