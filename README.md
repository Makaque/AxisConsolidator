# AxisConsolidator
Outer Wilds mod to align jetpack flight vertical look direction to either player or ship setting

This mod changes the behavior of the vertical (y-axis) look direction for the player when using the jetpack.

In the base game the vertical look direction while in zero-g with the jetpack is always opposite to the setting for the player while standing. This means that it is impossible to configure the y-axis to always be inverted in all situations, or to never be inverted in any situation.

-------------

This mod adds a setting for "Use Ship Look Direction."  
If the setting is disabled, the y-axis look direction while using the jetpack will match that of the player at all times.  
If the setting is enabled, the y-axis look direction while using the jetpack will match that of the ship.
